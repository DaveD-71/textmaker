# Project Journal

## 2026-03-24

- Startup bootstrap executed for the `textmaker` workspace.
- Confirmed the workspace is a Git repository rooted at `<repo-root>`.
- Checked remote sync state non-destructively with `git fetch --prune origin`; local `main` and `origin/main` were even at the time of bootstrap.
- Created missing repo-level bootstrap files: `AGENTS.md`, `user-learning-mirror.md`, `project-learning.md`, `project-journal.md`, and `instruction-read-log.csv`.
- Read `README.md` and promoted its durable content into `project-learning.md`.
- Established repo project memory as the main source for recording project developments, durable decisions, constraints, and roadmap changes going forward.

- Ran `textmaker.cmd markdown-to-docx` against the AME course summary markdown and produced `AME_course_summary_report.docm` in the client report folder; command required an in-session PATH prepend for local Pandoc (`C:\Users\d-dobson\AppData\Local\Pandoc`).

## 2026-05-09
- Updated `textmaker.cmd` to prepend the common local Pandoc install directory automatically when present.
- Updated `scripts/cli.py` so `markdown-to-docx` resolves relative input, reference, and output paths more robustly when launched through `cmd.exe` from a UNC-backed workspace.
- Verified the UNC case by running `..\..\textmaker\textmaker.cmd markdown-to-docx --input .\md\final\modules\aw-adv_mod1_n10.md --reference .\aw-adv-styleref.docx --output .\md\final\modules\aw-adv_mod1_from_relative.docx` from `book_administrative-writing\adv`, which completed successfully.
- Updated `scripts/cli.py` to normalize markdown before Pandoc by inserting blank lines before lists that directly follow prose, preventing list collapse in generated DOCX output.
- Added `--ignore-horizontal-rules` to drop standalone markdown separator lines such as `---` before conversion, avoiding unwanted page breaks when the pagebreak Lua filter is active.
- Added a semantic DOCX postprocessing layer driven by the reference DOCX. `markdown-to-docx` now applies custom styles and cloned prototype callout tables consistently for repeating textbook patterns such as `Why this works`, `Before you write`, teaching-point notes, model good/bad text blocks, homework word-count prompts, and post-list follow-on prompts.
- Verified the semantic pass on Module 1 by generating a temporary DOCX and confirming inserted `Why?` / `Check` / `Learn` / `Note` tables plus applied `Block Text Good`, `Block Text Bad`, `Homework Words`, and `After List` styles.
- Replaced the cloned-prototype-table approach with Word COM Quick Part insertion for unit title blocks only; the converter now launches a dedicated `DispatchEx` Word instance, inserts the real building block from `Normal.dotm`, and avoids touching unrelated `WINWORD.exe` processes.
- Reworked the Administrative Writing semantic formatting so only unit title tables remain as Quick Parts; `Why this works`, `Before you write`, `Teaching point`, `Note`, and related cues now stay paragraph-based to reduce visual dominance.
- Repaired the Module 1 demoted markdown hierarchy by keeping framework sections at `###`, activities at `####`, turning model labels into plain content labels, and converting the “Clarity Patterns” sequence away from a heading stack.
- Expanded `After List` styling so prompt-style lines such as `Practice ...`, `Reflect:`, and `Example:` can inherit the style after short commentary blocks, not only after literal list paragraphs.
- Removed all `*Tok` styles from `book_administrative-writing\adv\aw-adv-styleref.docx`, then repaired the resulting `word/styles.xml` corruption after an initial rewrite dropped the required compatibility namespace declarations from the root element.
- Regenerated the final Module 1 production candidate as `book_administrative-writing\adv\md\final\modules\aw-adv_mod1_n10_demoted_fixed.docx` and verified it contains three unit title Quick Part tables (`U1`, `U2`, `U3`) plus the broadened `After List` styling.

## 2026-05-12

- Added a repeatable Markdown style-audit utility for Advanced Administrative Writing source cleanup.
- Tightened `markdown-to-docx` so postprocess failures surface instead of being silently swallowed.
- Updated DOCX postprocessing to use only reference styles, remove `Strong`/direct bold output, color emoji labels from matching label styles, apply 6pt semantic label spacing, strip activity-code suffixes from headings, and broaden post-list spacing.
- Added a functional Markdown/DOCX paragraph audit report for Advanced Administrative Writing that groups by structural role rather than literal CSV text.
- Regenerated `aw-adv-all_0510.docx` through `textmaker.cmd markdown-to-docx` with `aw-adv-styleref.docx` as Pandoc `--reference-doc` and the Advanced Writing Lua Div filter enabled; validation confirmed no missing reference styles, no `Strong` run style, no direct bold, no remaining heading activity codes, and emoji runs without direct bold/italic markers.
- Regenerated `aw-adv-all_0510.pdf` from the validated DOCX with LibreOffice.
- Updated the Advanced Writing cleanup pipeline so DOCX postprocess purges generated style usage and style definitions not present in the reference DOCX; replaced `annotation` Divs in the working Markdown with `learn-note` and removed the `annotation` Lua mapping. No conversion was run for this change batch.

## 2026-05-13

- Regenerated the Advanced Administrative Writing DOCX through `textmaker.cmd markdown-to-docx --input ... --reference ... --lua-filter ...`, with `aw-adv-styleref.docx` passed through to Pandoc as `--reference-doc`.
- Added a postprocess cleanup for alphabetic option lists: `List Number 3` is applied to A/B/C option items and literal source markers are removed afterward to prevent doubled labels in PDF output.
- Validated the generated DOCX against the reference style set: no missing used styles, no extra style definitions, no `Strong` or `Emphasis` run styles, no direct bold tags, no activity-code suffix hits, and no literal alphabetic markers inside `List Number 3` paragraphs.
- Exported the validated DOCX to PDF with LibreOffice.
- Corrected the Advanced conversion command to use `--no-pagebreak-filter`; this keeps Textmaker from applying `pagebreak.lua` to standalone `---` separators and restores the PDF to the expected 186-page length.
- Updated semantic Div title postprocessing so title lines retain their semantic paragraph styles, with 4pt space after on the label paragraph and 0pt space before on the moved content paragraph.
- Updated unit-title table postprocessing so the original unit heading text is cleared after the reference table is inserted, preventing visible duplicate unit headings.
- Added a nested-list semantic Div pass so list paragraphs inside semantic Div blocks keep their list style while receiving the Div's block-level paragraph formatting. Regenerated the Advanced DOCX/PDF and validated that the nested list items have both list styling and Div border formatting.
